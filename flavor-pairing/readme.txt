== Description ==

Flavor Pairing Graph delivers a customizable flavor knowledge base by combining WordPress content management with a graph database. Curate ingredients, classify them in flavor families and techniques, and sync their relationships to an external graph engine for deep exploration.

== Features ==

* Ingredient custom post type with REST support.
* Flavor family and technique taxonomies for grouping.
* Admin meta boxes for flavor notes and seasonality.
* Pluggable adapter for Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, or other graph services.
* Shortcode for rendering simple pairing lists.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `flavor-pairing` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `'Plugins'` menu in WordPress.
3. Configure graph connection details under Settings â†’ Flavor Pairing (coming soon).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this ship with a graph database? =

No. You can connect to any external graph database that exposes a compatible API (for example, Neo4j HTTP API, Amazon Neptune, or RedisGraph).

= How do I customize the schema? =

Extend the `Flavor_Pairing_Graph_Adapter` class to map WordPress objects into your graph schema. Override `run_query` and related helpers.
